Yet another library for driving HX711 using an Arduino!

The core functionality comes from here:
https://github.com/MaxAtoms/Weigh-Scale-Arduino

and the other parts of code originates from here:
https://github.com/bogde/HX711

I used a LPF (Low pass filter) function instead of averaging the raw data.
